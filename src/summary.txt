NETS 150 HW5 Final Project: Degrees of Words
Group Members: Carol Li, Caroline Ma, Sophia Mark

Project Type: Implementation
Project Description: Often when someone is doing research online, it can be difficult to know what page to navigate
to next for the best results of a relevant term. We wanted to create a resource for this challenge. Our program takes
in two strings from user input and finds their similarity by navigating through the links on their Britannica pages.
The first string is the base URL, or main webpage our user was researching on. We iterate through all the links on
the main document to search for the second term, recording its term frequencies as well as the cosine similarities of
main document with each linked document. We also wanted to find the lengths of the linked documents because this
measure would provide insight on how useful or relevant the tf and cosine similarity measures are. The user can then
choose to sort linked documents based on tf, cosine similarity, or document length and the program will output a list
of linked articles ordered from highest to lowest score ranking. This program will ideally be helpful for particularly
students that don't have time to comb through all hyperlinks on a webpage for a relevant topic.

Assumptions:
    - No document has the same exact term frequency (# of occurences/total length) for the given query
    - No document has the same exact word count
    - No document has the same exact cosine similarity to the query text
    - User inputs relevant article page url from Britannica (content pages, not authors pages/contact information)

Project Concepts:
    1. Document Search: We search and scrape for text information on the Britannica website using JSoup
    2. Vector Space Model: Given two terms, we find their similarity statistics (tf, idf, cosine similarity) by using
    the text on their Britannica pages as topic-paragraphs

Work Breakdown:
    - Retrieve links, for each link store body text as String: Sophia
    - Calculate tf, idf, cosine similarity scores: Carol
    - User input with Scanner: Carol + Sophia
    - Creating tf, document length, and output maps: Caroline
    - Writeup: Caroline
