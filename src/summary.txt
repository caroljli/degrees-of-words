NETS 150 HW5 Final Project: Degrees of Words
Group Members: Carol Li, Caroline Ma, Sophia Mark

Project Type: Implementation
Project Description: Often when someone is doing research online, it can be difficult to know what page to navigate
to next for the best results of a relevant term. We wanted to create a resource for this challenge. Our program takes in two words from
user input and finds their similarity by navigating through the links on their Britannica pages. The first word is
used for the base url and treated as the main document. We iterate through all the links on the main document to
search for the second term, recording its term frequencies as well as the cosine similarities of main document with
each linked document. The user can then choose to sort linked documents based on tf, cosine similarity, or document length
and the program will output a list of linked articles ordered from highest to lowest score ranking.

We also wanted to find the lengths of the linked documents because this measure would provide insight on how useful or
relevant the tf and cosine similarity measures are.

Project Concepts:
    1. Document Search: We search and retrieve text information on the Britannica website using JSoup
    2. Vector Space Model: Given two terms, we find their similarity statistics (tf, idf, cosine similarity) by using
    the text on their Britannica pages as topic-paragraphs

Work Breakdown:
    - Retrieve links, for each link store body text as String: Sophia
    - Calculate tf, idf, cosine similarity scores: Carol
    - User input with Scanner: Carol
    - Creating output map: Caroline
    - Writeup: Caroline
